# Desktop Icon Organizer
Simple Windows app to organize your desktop chaos based on files extenions. This application idea emerged from an even simpler C# program I made to put all Steam games' shortcuts into a single folder.

• Choose a file type\
• Choose which extensions will be relocated\
• Choose a destination folder for your desktop items

→ Click RUN
